## Thanks ‚ù§

Project made with the [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) on Udemy. Thanks to the author [Jonas Schmedtman (Personnal WebSite)](https://codingheroes.io/index.html) ! This is a very good course for learn HTML and CSS.

## Every Step for build this WebSite

In this section, I talk about the steps I learn for create the project. This repository in principaly for help me in the future, but you can use it to help you as well.

### Step 1 : Defining the project

- WHO : For a client.
- WHAT :
  - Business goal : Selling monthly food subscription.
  - User goal : Eating well effortlessly, without spending a lot of time and money.
- TARGET AUDIENCE : Busy people who like technology, are interested in a healthy diet, and have a well-playing job.

### Step 2 : Planning the project

- Plan and gather website content (content.md).
- Plan out the sitemap : It's just a one-page marketing website (landing page), so no sitemap here.
- Define website personality : Based on the tech-centered target audience, as well as the actual product being sold, we will use the **startup/upbeat personality. We might add some elements of the **calm/peaceful\*\* personality, since the product is all about consumer well-being as well.
